While liquidity ratios have improved over the past year, profitability ratios have also shown some volatility. The company's high debt levels are a concern, and its leverage ratios suggest that it may be taking on too much risk. The company's strong revenue growth in 2021 was accompanied by a slight increase in its gross margin. However, its operating margin declined significantly, likely due to the increase in operating expenses.\\nPanel C ||| The company's financial performance in 2021 was strong, but its high debt levels and volatile operating expenses are concerns.

However, the debt-to-equity ratio has also been increasing, suggesting that the company is relying more heavily on debt financing. The company's profitability ratios, such as gross profit margin and net profit margin, have remained relatively stable, indicating that the company is managing its profitability despite the increasing costs.\\nPanel C |||  The company's earnings are expected to be impacted by the ongoing cost pressures and increased debt financing.
